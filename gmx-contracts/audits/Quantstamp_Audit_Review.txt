This review clarifies the medium risk issue highlighted by Quantstamp regarding the Timelock contracts.

High impact functions require two transactions to execute:

1. Signal transaction
2. 24 hour delay
3. Finalize transaction

The signal transactions can be initiated by the admin of the Timelock.

If the admin signals a malicious transaction, during the 24 hour delay, the multi-sig of the Timelock can change the admin, which will prevent the malicious transaction from being finalized.

The current multi-sig holders: https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-contracts/blob/master/scripts/access/deployTokenManager.js.

Timelocks can be monitored by anyone, reporting of a malicious timelock transaction is covered under the GMX Immunefi bounty: https://immunefi.com/bounty/gmx/.

The Timelock contracts allow some configuration to be changed without a two step process, for example, setting of open interest caps and token weights.

This is to allow the platform to adapt quickly if needed, ideally the need for active adjustments should be minimized and the contracts have since been improved towards that goal.

These improvements are in https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics.

The improved contracts automate most processes, isolate risks for LPs, provide better protection against price manipulation, allowing active adjustments to no longer be needed for things like weights and caps
